# On_Decompression_Effect_of_different_Quantization_Fator
Analyzing the results demonstrated by the images after decompression on applying different values of quantization factor ‘L’ and comparing them to the original images before compression. Using a client-server setup compression techniques (DCT, quantization, RLC) are performed at the client side, then a compressed image is sent to server through TCP-IP and finally decompression is performed on the server side.
